# Sofwares #

You will need different softwares:

**Arduino**

This soft will allow you to compile and upload the code to your multicopter. Download it from [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

**Mission Planner**

The Mission Planner is used to set up your multicopter, get the telemtry data and use Mission Planning. Download it from ArduPilot Mega repository [here](http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/downloads/list)

**MegaPirate code**

There are different versions, developped by different coders.
You will find them under the [download section](http://code.google.com/p/megapirate/downloads/list) of this site.

## Installation ##

The best is to create a new folder under C:, called as you want, for example Megapirate.
Install Arduino in this folder and create a new folder called Sketches.

In Arduino folder, you will find a folder called libraries. Copy it into a safe place and delete it from here. You will maybe need to copy and paste some original files from those libraries into your new libraries folder.

When downloading the code, you will find in every zip file a folder called MegaPirate and a folder called libraries.
  * Past the MegaPirate folder into the Sketches folder
  * Past libraries into Arduino

Open arduino and then find Preferences under File.
Set the stetchbook location to the correct one.
