# Breakout Boards #

In order to help doing a clean setup, you will find some nice breakout board, allowing you to mount your IMU.

At the Flyduino shop, you will find the [Flydusense V1.2](http://flyduino.net/V12-Flydusense-Senosr-Bob) and the [Flydusense V2](http://flyduino.net/Flydusense-V2-with-LLC).

If you're using a Seeeduino board, this [board](http://viacopter.eu/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=27&category_id=10&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=53) could also be helpful, at the Viacopter shop. It's mainly dedicated to MultiWii but can be used with MegaPirate.
