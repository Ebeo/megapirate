= LED warning for low battery =

Based on the [http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/led-low-battery-warning-on excellent tutorial] from u4eake on DIYDrones forum, here's a quick how-to.

== Hardware setup ==

Here's a schematic (provided by thnilsen on RCGroups) showing how to make the voltage divider:

It's also possible to use the [http://flyduino.net/Flydusense-V2-mit-LLC Flydusense V2], which is ready for the voltage divider and the LED driver.

Now, you will need to make the LED driver.
Here's a schematic (provided by aBUGSnightmare on RCGroups), using a [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/312 ULN2803] (transistor. Each output can handle up to 500mA:

Here's a [http://oomlout.com/8TRA/8TRA-Guide.pdf nice guide] about the ULN2803.

You can also used the built in LED driver of the Flydusense V2.

*Connections between Flyduino and voltage divider/LED driver*

Connect the output of your voltage divider to PIN A0 of the Flyduino.
Then, connect the PIN A1 to the IN of the ULN2803 corresponding to the OUT driving your lEDs.

If you're using the Flydusense V2, connect the PIN A1 to the CPU PIN, near the LED driver.
